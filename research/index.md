My primary research develops human-centered deep learning tools that support creative audio workflows—enabling practitioners to transform, shape, and generate sound through interfaces where the relationship between user input and sonic output is intuitive, expressive, and controllable. 

Outside of this, I also look at how algorithmic systems reshape musical experience, bridging methods from HCI and computational musicology to examine questions of influence attribution, algorithmic mediation, and the broader social impacts of how we collectively listen to and engage with sound.

### Towards Expressive, Controllable Deep Learning Tools for Creative Audio Production
- [**Mix2Morph** (ICASSP 2026)](/mix2morph) — While interning at Adobe, I explored new ways to do sound morphing.
- [**Text2FX** (ICASSP 2025)](/text2fx) — How can we control audio FX like EQ and reverb using natural language descriptions instead of technical parameters? By leveraging the CLAP embedding space and differentiable signal processing, the system maps high-level semantic intent ("make this guitar warm and dreamy") to interpretable, refinable DSP parameters.
- [**Text2EQ** (ISMIR LBD 2024)](/text2fx/text2eq) — Human-in-the-loop interface exploring interactive refinement of text-guided audio processing


### Understanding Music in the Age of Algorithms
- **Listening in the Age of the Algorithm (ongoing)** — A collaboration with [NOISE](https://sites.northwestern.edu/noise/people/) lab, This work examines how recommendation systems on streaming platforms shape musical discovery and listening behavior, aiming to understand algorithmic mediation's impact on musical culture and listening practices (to be presented at *Clouds, Streams, and Ground Truths 2026*).
